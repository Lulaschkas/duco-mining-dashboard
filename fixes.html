                <p class="subtitle"><b>Too high hashrate</b></p>
                </center>
                <p>Yes, you've heard that right. Mining with too high hashrate is not good. DuinoCoin is using a 
                    System called 'Kolka' to make fair rewards for strong and weak miners. This system is for example raising the difficulty if someone is mining with a really powerful pc,
                    so it is not possible for people with GPUs or very strong CPUs to earn more than a few Arduinos would do.
                    Mining with strong devices also isn't the point of duinocoin. As the name suggests DuinoCoin is mostly
                    for Arduinos and other low power devices. What's more, hashrate isn't equal to earning more Coins in Duinocoin.
                    <br>
                    If the mining dashboard showed you the Error, that you are mining with too high hashrate, you probably wont make more than 30-40 
                    Coiny per day but spend a lot of energy on your device. In this case you should think about:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Setting the difficulty setting to Net or Extreme depending on your device</li>
                    <li>Not mining with big CPUs / GPUs</li>
                    <li>Lowering mining intensity</li>
                    <li>Mining another coin like Magi for example</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <center><p class="subtitle">Too low Hashrate</p></center>
                <p>Sometimes it can happen that you are mining with too low hashrate. This 
                    is mostly caused by a high difficult that got sended to your device or wrong difficult settings.
                    If you are mining with Raspberry Pi and other low Power devices, please double check your Miner settings.
                    (For example not setting difficulty to Network)

                <p>If this Error pops up, one of your devices has more than 5% of his shares rejected by the main server.
                    This can be caused by:

                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Old miner Version</li>

                    <li>Mining much to fast so Kolka limits you</li>

                <center><p class="subtitle">Does not start mining</p></center>
                <p>Somtimes your miner connects to the server but doesnt submit any shares or stucks after the first one.
                    This was a problem with some old miner versions please upgrade and try again.

                <p>Duino-Coin uses a System called Kolka to keep mining fair for everyone.
                This system prevents GPU mining as well as huge mining farms.</p>
                <p>And it does this by cutting down profit for every new mining connection</p>
                
                <p>New mining connections from PCs are cut down by 20% for each new connection.</p>
                <p>This looks like this: Miner1-100%, Miner2-80%, Miner3-64%, Miner4-51%...</p>
                <p>For Arduinos and ESPs, the cut down for every new connection is only 4%</p>
                <p>This looks like this: Miner1-100%, Miner2-96%, Miner3-92%, Miner4-88%...</p>
                <p>With this system it is still possibl to make good profit with AVR mining, which obviously is the key aspect of DUINO-coin.</p>

                </center>
                <p>If you get the error, that you are mining too fast with your Arduino this is mostly no reason to worry about.
                    Sometimes the hashrate spikes very short or the server has an issue but if the problem stays you should take a look.
                    Check if you are using an unoffical miner which maybe tries to bypass Kolka limits (which doesnt work since V4).

                <center><p class="subtitle">Too low Hashrate</p></center>
                <p>Sometimes your Arduino might mine with a hashrate lower than 100H/s. This can be caused by 
                    a short connection issue but also because the Arduino isnt flashed to the newest AVR code. 
                    You can download the new Arduino file with the newest duco release: <a href="https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/releases">DuinoCoin Releases</a>

                <center><p class="subtitle">Does not start mining</p></center>
                <p>The most problems while mining with Arduinos come from even starting the miner for the first time. 
                    If you start the connect software on linux and try to select your board you might get a permission error.
                    This can easily be fixed by running the program with root or adding your user to the dialout groupe with: <code>sudo usermod -a -G dialout USERNAME</code> 
                    then relogin and try again.
                </p>
                <p>Also before using the software you might have to download some packages. If you havent python3 installed, do this first. Then install the requiered packages the software has shown you with <code>python3 -m pip install packagename</code></p>

                    <p>If you are using ESP32 and the hashrate drops you are very likely using an old version of the miner.
                        Because the old Versions didnt have a reset build in if the hashrate goes to low.</p>
                        <p>You should be able to get better resulty by improoving wifi quality and always upgrading to the newest Version.
                        You can download the new ESP32/8266 file with the newest duco release: <a href="https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/releases">DuinoCoin Releases</a>

                    <p>
                        Make sure that the correct CPU Frequency is set when uploading the sketch, i.e. 160 MHz for an ESP8266.
